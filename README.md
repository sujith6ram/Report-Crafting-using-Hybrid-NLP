# 📝 Report Crafting using Hybrid NLP

## 📌 Overview

**Report Crafting using Hybrid NLP** is an intelligent report generation tool that accepts unstructured input from users and produces a fully formatted, grammatically correct project report aligned with predefined academic or institutional guidelines.

This project integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques — including **Grammatical Error Correction (GEC)** using transformer-based models — along with a layout formatting engine that:
- Aligns text and images,
- Applies specific font styles, sizes, and spacing,
- Follows your college's official formatting rules.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ **User Input Parser** – Accepts raw content sections (e.g., introduction, objectives, methodology).
- 🧠 **Grammar Correction** – Uses a transformer-based GEC model to fix grammar and spelling mistakes in input text.
- 🖼️ **Image Placement** – Automatically places images in the report as per the content and context.
- 🧾 **Automated Formatting** – Applies formatting rules such as:
  - Font size (e.g., Times New Roman, 12pt)
  - Line spacing
  - Heading styles
  - Margins and alignments
- 📄 **Final Output** – Generates a ready-to-submit DOCX or PDF report in standard academic format.
